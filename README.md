# SelfContainedScripts.jl

SelfContainedScripts lets you write self-contained Julia scripts that declare their dependencies inline using [PEP 723â€“style metadata blocks](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/).

## Installation

We recommend you (and anyone who wants to run your scripts) install SelfContainedScripts
in their default global environment:
```bash
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/cjdoris/SelfContainedScripts.jl.git");'
```

Or equivalently:
```
$ julia

julia> # press ] to enter the Pkg REPL

pkg> add https://github.com/cjdoris/SelfContainedScripts.jl.git
```

## Example script

Here is a working self-contained Julia script, copied from `examples/example.jl`:

```julia
# /// project
# name = "example"
# 
# [deps]
# Example = "7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a"
# ///
using SelfContainedScripts
SelfContainedScripts.activate()

using Example
@show Example.hello("Alice")
```

Provided you have installed SelfContainedScripts into your default global environment,
this can be simply run like this:
```bash
julia example.jl
```

## Example workflow

Let's reproduce the above example script.

First, open Julia and run the following:
```julia
using SelfContainedScripts
SelfContainedScripts.init("example.jl")
```

This will create a stub file with this content:
```julia
# /// project
# name = "example"
# ///
using SelfContainedScripts
SelfContainedScripts.activate()

# your code here
```

As well as creating `example.jl`, the `init()` call above created and activated an
ordinary Julia project at `~/.julia/environments/self-contained-scripts/example`. Now
we can modify the project using ordinary `Pkg` functions and then use `sync()` to update
the `project` block in the script.
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Example")
SelfContainedScripts.sync()
```

Now the script contains the dependency we just added:
```julia
# /// project
# name = "example"
#
# [deps]
# Example = "7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a"
# ///
using SelfContainedScripts
SelfContainedScripts.activate()

# your code here
```

Now edit the script to add its main functionality:
```julia
# /// project
# name = "example"
# 
# [deps]
# Example = "7876af07-990d-54b4-ab0e-23690620f79a"
# ///
using SelfContainedScripts
SelfContainedScripts.activate()

using Example
@show Example.hello("Alice")
```

And you're done! You can run it directly like so:

```bash
julia example.jl
```

Finally, you can share this script with others to run themselves. All they need to do
is install SelfContainedScripts.jl themselves in their global environment.

If you come back later to update the script and need to change the dependencies, it's
as simple as this:
```julia
using SelfContainedScripts, Pkg

# Activate the project for the script.
SelfContainedScripts.activate("example.jl")

# Modify the project as needed.
Pkg.add(...)

# Sync the updated Project.toml into the script.
SelfContainedScripts.sync()
```

## Existing scripts

If you have an existing Julia project containing a script you want to "upgrade" to be
self-contained you can simply call

```julia
using SelfContainedScripts, Pkg
Pkg.activate("your-project")
SelfContainedScripts.sync("your-script.jl")
```

which will copy the current Project.toml into the given script.

## API
We have these functions:
- `init(script=nothing; name=nothing, activate=true, resolve=true)` creates or updates a
  script with a project block and activation code. Activates the environment unless
  activate=fasle.
- `activate(script=nothing; resolve=true)` creates or updates a project from the
  embedded project block in the script, activates and resolves it.
- `sync(script=nothing)` copy the currently active Project.toml into the script.

The automatically created Julia project is at `~/.julia/environments/self-contained-scripts/<name>`
where `<name>` is as given in the project block, or is derived from the filename if not
given.

By default these functions work on `script=PROGRAM_FILE` if it is set. The `script` arg
is remembered and reused in future calls if not given, so `init("foo.jl"); sync()` is
equivalent to `init("foo.jl"); sync("foo.jl")`.

See the docstrings for further details.
